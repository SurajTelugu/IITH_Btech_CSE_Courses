\section{Introduction:}
Russell's Antinomy or Russell's Paradox is a prominent set theoretical 
paradox which is also known as Russell-Zermelo Paradox.It was discovered
by Bertrand Arthur William Russell,British Logician,Philosopher and  Mathematician in 1901 it was first observed by Ernst Zermelo in 1899
but was not thought much important.While working on Principles of
Mathematics Russell encountered the paradox studying cantor power
class theorem: Carnality of set strictly less than its power set.
Gottlob Frege whose lifelong project was to demonstrate that 
Foundation of Mathematics was Logic made him research many years and
published "Grundgesetze der Arithmetik(The Basic laws of Arithmetic)"
where he proposed a set theory which was thought to be ideal and
perfect but Russell wrote his problem in terms of both logic and 
set theory to Frege which lead his theory and his idea of logic to
be inconclusive. Let us study the paradox,its consequences and how 
we have avoided this problem in detail.

\section{Paradox statement in different forms:}
\subsection{Barber Paradox}
Lets think about the paradox in elementary English form 
The barber Paradox which was derived from Russell's Paradox
\textbf{"Barber in the village shaves the beard of every person in 
the village who do not shave his beard himself now, the question is
\underline{should the barber shave himself or not?}"}
\\ 
Clearly we cannot answer the question if we think he shaves himself
the according to the rule he should not if he does not shave himself 
then he should we consider any of the two possibility hence its a 
paradox.

\subsection{Russell's Paradox in Set Theory}
Naive idea of set theoretical concept of paradox is if we take a set
of all people in the village who does not shave themselves then by 
the above paradoxical idea should we include barber in the set or not.
More generally, lets consider the following set in set builder form
and define the paradox symbolically:
$$ Let \, S=\{x \,|\, x \notin x\}\,then\,S \in S \iff S\notin S $$ 
\newpage
\noindent \textbf{"Let $S$ be Set of all sets which do not contain
themselves should $S$ contain the Set $S$ in it i.e should it contain 
itself or not?"}
\\
If we assume $S \notin S$ then the set $S$ should be added in it as 
per its definition then it contradicts its own definition that sets
which do not contain themselves so we conclude that we are now again
in the similar situation as of Barber Paradox and cannot decide  $S$
should be added in $S$ or not in either way it leads to a contradiction.

\subsection{Russell's Paradox in Logical view}
From the theory of predicate logic consider the following binary
predicate where $\varphi(x)$ is substituted with $x\notin x$
 $$\exists y \,\forall x(x \in y \iff \varphi(x)) $$
 
\noindent After substituting $\varphi(x)$ with $x\notin x$ followed by
by existential instantiation of variable $y$ with some constant set $Y$
and universal instantiation of $x$ with $Y$ we get
                 $$Y\in Y  \iff Y \notin Y$$
Hence a contradiction and again we observe similar situation as 
observed above.

\section{Consequences and effects on Mathematics:}
Frege's analogies were proved to be incorrect but that's not the end
no other mathematical analogy or theory provided an explanation to the
paradox.Many mathematicians at that time really did not care about 
Russell's paradox but to form any new theory in set theory and logic
the paradox was a great hurdle, they soon realised no mathematical 
proof was trustworthy and only by eliminating paradox mathematics can
prove its consistency.
\par \null \par
\noindent Any Axiomatic foundation in Mathematics has to be precise 
that there should be $0$ probability of proving the axiom wrong,
but Frege's axioms were proved to be wrong by Russell through his
paradox and Frege was not able provide any justification to overcome
it so he mentioned Russell Paradox in his book's appendix his work
on finding Foundation of Mathematics was not complete Though we
still use Frege's Axioms.There is no theory that provides an answer
to paradox besides the paradox is being avoided to prove the 
consistency of mathematics.

\section{Reason for Frege's Failure:}
Although Frege was extremely careful designing his theory he simply
gave permission to form any list of distinct elements as set such 
paradox is basically possible due to this.From principle of
Pseudo-Scotus if such paradoxes or contractions are appeared in 
a theory any statement can be proven to be true and thus destroys 
the significance of entire theory erasing the difference between 
truth and false thus Frege's theory was unsuccessful because his 
theory made Russell's Paradox possible but it did not provide any
solution or avoided the Russell Paradox. 

\newpage
\section{Possible Solutions to the Paradox:}
There is no rigorous solution to the paradox until now.There are
mainly two counter measures made to avoid Paradox.They are
Russell's Type Theory, Zermelo's Axioms. Zermelo's Axioms were
widely accepted which further evolved into Zermelo-Frankel
Set Theory which uses Axiom of Choices famously known as ZFC's 
accepted by all mathematicians and considered as Foundation of
on going Mathematics. Russell has changed the idea of Logic and
tried to avoid Paradox though Types and Set Theory based on Type
Theory.
\subsection{How ZFC'S Successfully Avoided Russell Paradox}
Zermelo's Theory was an updated version of Frege's set theory and
his axioms.He brilliantly avoided the paradox without actually changing
the fundamental idea of Logic.The change of following Axiom has made
solution possible.
\par \null \par
\noindent Zermelo method of avoiding the Paradox is replacing the 
 following axiom \\
$\forall P(x) \, \exists \, a\,set\,y=\{x\,|\,P(x)\}$ from Frege's
set of Axioms with the following Axiom 
$$(\forall P(x) \land \, \forall set\,b)\, \exists set 
y=\{x\,|x\in set\,b \,\land P(x)\} $$
The difference between above two axioms is that in Frege's Axiom
there was no proper domain defined for variable for $x$ which
unknowingly freed $x$ and makes such paradoxes possible it gives 
liberty to the set definer and one can define any type of set 
from a predicate and a free variable thus Russell Paradox is defined
in such Axiomatic mathematics and Maths becomes Inconsistent

\noindent While the second Axiom strictly says $x$ has to be itself
contained in a set to be used to define a set restricts the usage of
variable $x$ in whatever way we can cleverly avoid the paradox in
both set theory and logical view. A set of x can only be used for
a predicate not any x makes the $R=\{x \,|\, x \notin x\}$ not 
a set but a class.As it is not a set concept of Russell paradox
does not show up.
Naive set theory and Frege's set theory failed in avoiding Russell's
Paradox where ZFC's have efficiently avoided Russell Paradox instead of 
solving it in order to maintain Consistency of Mathematics. 

\subsection{Solution by Russell Using Theory of Types}
Russell used Theory of Types which uses the concept of Existential 
hierarchy. There were $3$ levels of distinction which are Objects, 
Predicates, Predicates of Predicates.Russell's idea was to define 
sets that are not member of themselves and individual sets are on 
different level i.e they are of different type and thus avoiding the 
paradox in logical view. Russell further developed the concept to 
sets by considering Classes and individuals so on and and defining 
an Axiom that classes cannot be members of themselves and so as
individuals so on.Russell simply avoided the paradox by saying
set $R$ is class and the other sets are like individuals.
$$5^{th} Axiom \, \varepsilon P=\varepsilon Q \equiv \forall x \,
(P(x)\equiv Q(x))$$
This axiom is used to escape from Russell's Paradox in gives a 
relation between same type entities

\newpage
$$R(x) \iff \exists S\,[x=\varepsilon S \land \neg S(x)]$$
Russell's Paradox representation in type theory
$$R(\varepsilon R) \equiv \neg R(\varepsilon R)$$
Thus Russell's Paradox both Sets has been successfully shown as 
different types and circumvent Russell Paradox.Though This theory
used by advanced mathematics to prove some results it is portrayed
more like definition based and does not involve logic hence it 
was not used by logicians and was less famous among Mathematicians.

\subsection{Some more Solutions:}
Even W.V Quine who coined the term Russell Antinomy to the 
Russell Paradox has tried to solve the paradox in his way and
suggested a solution(method to escape) which also involved Type
Theory.He introduced a new concept Stratification which assigns 
natural number values to individuals of a class and does not allow
new member to join easily.thus blocking Russell's Paradox.
\par \null \par
\noindent Another possible counter measure to the Paradox given by
Aussonderung who avoids Russell's paradox by another axiom similar
to Zermelo's Axiom.$x$ is a subset of $P$ that satisfies condition 
$C$ if and only if $x$ satisfies condition $C$.

\section{Further Developments and Applications:}
Many new Paradoxes have been developed by simple modifications of 
Russell Paradox i.e "The \rule{1cm}{0.15mm} er  of all 
\rule{1cm}{0.15mm} that do not contain themselves" Grellingâ€“Nelson
paradox, Richard's paradox are developed from Russell's Paradox
which fills the blank with Describe and Denote respectively.
Russell's paradox and some other paradoxes have challenged
mathematicians to provide new theories and led to the birth of 
Type Theory and ZFC'S. Still active research is going on to 
provide more rigorous solution to the Paradox.
There are not much applications to the paradox but it is definitely
avoided in any newly formed theory otherwise entire theory would
be invalid and marked to be inconsistent.

\section{Conclusion to Russell's Antinomy:}
I worked on this report to provide some basic idea about Russell
Paradox, its significance and some solutions provided to avoid it
through this report. I slighted went through the history and 
provided English analogical definition to Russell's Paradox and 
also thoroughly went through its solutions,Finally gone through 
further developments in the paradox. This Report gives an idea how
mathematicians who try to build new theories worked to avoid Russell
Paradox. Though Russell Paradox has not helped to solve 
any new problems avoiding it in our theory mainly avoids all other
issues and provides an ideal Axiomatic Theory which helps to 
solve all the problems.

\newpage
\noindent With greater Axioms and complexity of theory greater
Paradoxes or Antinomies may also be possible a theory should be 
strict enough to avoid such Paradoxes and thus providing an ideal
Theory.Formation of any new  Axiomatic theory one should consider the
possibility of Russell Paradox and try avoiding it.The Paradox has 
devastated Frege's work and also proved Naive set theory
inconsistent.Avoiding such paradoxes helps us to solve further results
instead of trying to solve it. Hence both Zermelo and Russell have 
tried to avoid the Paradox instead of solving it.Therefore we can 
conclude that Paradoxes in Mathematics can be dangerous but avoiding
them would provide us compatible results.
